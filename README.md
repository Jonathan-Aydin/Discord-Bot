# Discord-Bot
Discord bot I created in order to bring some fun into my friends' server, and to learn how to make more complex bots in the future.

Hello!

I created this simple Discord bot as a way to get more comfortable with using Python libraries while also
learning the fundamentals of creating a Discord bot. I wanted it to have a lot of fun features for me and
my friends to use in our server, and I'm happy with the way it turned out. Currently, I am working on a 
more advanced Discord bot, so let me know if there's any cool features an/or games you want it to have!

Thanks for checking out my project,
 -Jonathan Aydin
